This utility allows you to rename a serie of files (they do not even have to be in the same folder) according to a pattern.

Use it to add an extension, change the extension, suffix a number, replace part of the name... of hundreds of files with a simple click!

You can see the new names of the files in a list to make sure the result is what you expect, before renaming the files.
