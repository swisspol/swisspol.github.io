The Hold-Up personal finance manager software was created by Pierre-Olivier Latour and Didier Larue.

Like any other personal finance manager, you can manage several accounts, enter an unlimited number of transactions, create scheduled transactions, define categories, payment types...

BUT here's why this product is way better than other products:
Contrary to others personal finance managers, Hold-Up has a nice and very well designed user interface, and most important, it has exclusive features like:

- powerful filters (which display only transactions that match some criteria),
- multiple transactions edition in one dialog,
- automatic transaction name completion,
- dynamic notes (they popup under the mouse),
- a lighting fast search field,
- several skins (Platinum, Aqua...),
- currency conversion...
