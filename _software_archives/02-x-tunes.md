X-Tunes is a free utility to to control iTunes without bringing iTunes to the foreground, or having the iTunes window on screen.

Contrary to iTunes or other controllers, X-Tunes does not display a window permanently on screen, but only when you press a given key combination (Apple+Space by default). This window appears in front of all applications so you can click on its buttons while remaining in the current application. As soon as you release the key combination, the window disappears smoothly.

For those who wonder, here's why I think controlling iTunes through the dock is not efficient at all and something else was needed:

- you first need to find where's iTunes in the dock (not that fast if you have plenty of icons in your dock),
- you have to send your mouse to the very low bottom of the screen,
- the menu needs about half a second before appearing,
- for each operation you want to do, you need to select again and again items in the menu (skip tracks for example),
- you cannot set the volume. It's simply not practical.
