PixelShox Studio's revolutionary new approach in 2D/3D animation creation helps both novice and professional users in designing complex and interactive video effects through an intuitive Aqua interface.

Such animations are rendered in real-time on the computer's screen thanks to OpenGL and can be used either for personal enjoyment, or professionally in any project where interactive visuals are required: VJing, multimedia installations, presentations, concerts...

Completely hardware accelerated and using fully the latest Mac OS X technologies (OpenGL, CoreAudio, CoreMIDI, Cocoa...), this node-based 2D/3D video animation tool unleashes your creative inspiration with more than a 100 plug-ins (from basic mathematic operators to live video import), virtually unlimited number of compositions and layers, well-designed user-interface and great performances even on low-end machines!

PixelShox Studio is built on top of the PixelShox 3D Engine, a highly-flexible and extensible plug-in based OpenGL engine, designed to take advantage of the latest and upcoming technologies. In case you are missing a functionnality, you can even create your own plug-in(s) with the PixelShox SDK.
