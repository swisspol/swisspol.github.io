X-Sat is a utility that downloads directly from the Internet the latest satellite images among a predefined set of areas (Earth, USA, Europe, Africa, Asia...).

You can configure X-Sat to download automatically a given satellite image each time you launch it.

If you often look at the satellite image of your country to guess the upcoming weather, you will love X-Sat!
X-Sat is also a valuable learning tool for children interested in world geography.
