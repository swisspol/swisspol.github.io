WaterRace is an offshore racing game with unique characters, levels and ships, each having their own technical characteristics. Mastering the different ships and levels is an extraordinary challenge.
The beauty and the diversity of the circuits located in different parts of the world, and the incredible soundtrack create a thrilling atmosphere.

WaterRace was developed by an independent team of 8 european developers called "French Touch". They worked as free-lancers during 2 years on this game and during their free time, to bring this original game to the Mac.
