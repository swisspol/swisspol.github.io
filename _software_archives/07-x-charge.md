X-Charge is a battery monitoring software for iBook and PowerBook owners. It displays an antialiased graph of the battery charge over time (up to 24 hours) and keep in a log file all battery related events.

X-Charge is a very useful utility to analyse the state of your battery.

X-Charge also resuscitates the cool looking dock icon that displayed the current charge of the battery in MacOS X 10.0, which unfortunately was removed from further versions of the OS.
