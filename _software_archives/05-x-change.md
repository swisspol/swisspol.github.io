X-Change is a powerful currency converter in a nice interface: it displays the latest exchange rates between numerous currencies, and of course, allows you to convert amounts from a currency to another.

X-Change automatically downloads the latest exchange rates from the European Central Bank.

If, like me, you often need to do currency conversions, you will likely find X-Change more practical than these conversion tools you find on some web pages.
