Turbulence Sound Studio was supposed to be the new AudioFusion while being at the same time the first semi-professional audio software on MacOS X.

Turbulence Sound Studio was built on a very powerful audio engine:

- unlimited number of channels: each channel may be a sequencer track or an audio source: audio CD, Microphone, audio data over a TCP/IP network, AIFF Direct To Disk, MP3 Direct To Disk...
- unlimited number of buses,
- up to 32 connections (channels, buses or FX send) per bus,
- unlimited number of FX per track or bus,
- supports audio FX (insert or send) and visual FX,
- internal sound engine in 32 bits floating point for higher precision improved dynamic and running at up to 96Khz (4 times better than CD quality) and above (internal sound engine sample rate unlimited),
- all conversions to / from internal sound engine done with floating-point linear interpolation,
- sample-precise sequencer,
- supports any even number of outputs,
- gain, volume and balance on each channel or bus,
- kernel can import 8 or 16 bits, mono or stereo, any sample rate sound data,
- kernel can export 8,16,32,64 integer or float at any sample rate,
- full automation,
- add/remove channels, buses, fx and edit them all in real-time,
- works with VM on or OFF,
- 100% powerpc code,
- optimized for G3,
- 100% carbonized: works under MacOS X,
- imports AIFF, AIFC, System 7, System 7 compressed, MP3...
- truly open plug-in architecture: audio fx, visual fx, timebase, file import, file export, sound generators, bridges...
- support bridge plugins to import plug-ins from other applications: SoundJam visual plug-ins, Steinberg VST fx, Steinberg ASIO (MacOS 8 & 9 only)...
- skins

The Audio Engine was 80% complete (the automation and sequencer were left to be implemented and about 50 plugs-ins were written) and I was starting the user interface when I lost the source code after a disk crash - I hadn't any backup of it or I lost it...
