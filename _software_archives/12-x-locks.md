X-Locks is an application that allows you to keep all your passwords, serial numbers, access codes... in a secured database, inside your Documents folder.

The X-Locks Database is fully encrypted with a Master Password to ensure its privacy (up to 448 bits encryption).

The Master Password can be stored inside the MacOS Keychain so that you don't need to type it each time you launch X-Locks.
