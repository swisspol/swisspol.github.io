Hit Factory was my first "big" program and also my first shareware. I developed it while I was learning programming on the Mac.

Hit Factory was the first easy-to-use music creation tool on the Mac, even before the fashion for Music Maker-like programs started on the PC started.

Here's a clip from its description:

*Hit Factory brings you a stereo sampler (with 8 to 30 tracks) with Direct To Disk possibilities, a stereo synthesizer (up to 10 channels of polyphony) and a stereo rhythms box (up to 10 channels of polyphony). Furthermore you can record everything you do, then reproduce (automation) or modify it. With this software, you will be able to create easily your own music or remix the ones you like. Hit Factory is the perfect software for all thoses who like to create dance music, techno, trance, rap... and "LIVE" remixes. Thanks to its Direct To Disk capabilities, it can also be used as a multitracks audio numeric recorder for "rock" musicians*

Hit Factory, later renamed AudioFusion, had a pretty good success as a shareware and I eventually set up a partnership with Syclone Multimedia in Montreal, Canada to take care of the distribution.
