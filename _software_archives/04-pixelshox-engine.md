The PixelShox Engine is a 3D engine completely designed for real-time video animation. It uses OpenGL for the best possible rendering quality: most rendering is done in hardware by the video card and not by the computer's CPU, allowing to render complex effects in very high quality without taking down the whole computer.

The PixelShox Engine has a complety modular design: it contains a set of more than 100 plug-ins that you connect together to build "Effects". Then you can have several effects on screen at the same time.

This engine is available for licensing and is designed to be multiplatform.
