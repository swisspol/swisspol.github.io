X-Movie is QuickTime player clone written in Cocoa. It's nicer, less intrusive, more responsive than the original QuickTime player provided by Apple.

Unfortunately, because of very poor support of QuickTime through Cocoa (interface bugs, very difficult to save files...), I've stopped its development.

In this 0.9 version, editing and full-screen are not functional.
