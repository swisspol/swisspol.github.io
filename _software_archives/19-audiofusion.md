AudioFusion was a new version of Hit Factory with a redesigned interface (the new name was a consequence of an intellectual property conflict).

Here's the former description of the product:

*This software reproduces all the devices of the techno world (sampler, synthesizer, beat box) with advantages of the computer. With the help of its five units (sampler, synthetizer, beat box and editor), AudioFusion TWS will transform your Mac into a real studio. Moreover, thanks to its help mixing system (quantize), you will be able to easily create your own music or remix other favorites. AudioFusion TWS is also a professional music software. Thanks to its powerful MIDI compatibility and its AIFF export, this program is essential to the home studio of the musician or the multimedia creator.*

AudioFusion was distributed by Syclone Multimedia, Canada.
