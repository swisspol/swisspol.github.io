MidiHID transforms USB devices into powerful MIDI controllers on Mac OS X Leopard. Use it to connect any USB HID compatible device (keyboard, joysticks, game controllers... even Guitar Hero ones), to any MIDI compatible software running on your Mac.

MidiHID is fully extensible thanks to configuration files that describe how to translate USB events to MIDI messages for a given device. Configuration files are written using the fast and lightweight [Lua scripting language](http://www.lua.org/), which ensures minimal processor usage and latency during your performance.
