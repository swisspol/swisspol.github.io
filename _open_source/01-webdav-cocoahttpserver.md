For the open-source Cocoa HTTP Server project, I implemented full WebDAV class 1 support and partial WebDAV class 2 support for Mac OS X Finder compatibility.

You can check out the source code from: [https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaHTTPServer](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaHTTPServer).
